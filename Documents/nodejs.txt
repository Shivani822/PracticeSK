node jS
install 
is a JS engine runtime environment 
its used to build standlone application on physical machine, browser, has multiple modules 
For using it along with frameworks ex express js is webapp framework

Each browser has its own JS engine ex: V8 -chrome, edge 
spidermonkey chakra etc.

JS is client side language+ server side now.
Chocolatey is windows NPM node package manager
VS code along for application development

EXPRESS
along with nodejs we get npm installed
--> npm install express
express is a framework we can see node_modules on the left explorer once gets downloaded along with other dependencies modules
along with package.json & package_lock json files.
if need any older version just see documents command & can get it.

Creating a package custom, need to give relative path as not inbuilt module.

Scope of require() method is 1 line for keep using the scope we need to assign its value in.
var cal = require('./calc.js') # in this file we have function add defined

But to call module in other module we need to access special way(its not like obj.fun unlike other programming langs)
result=cal.add(4,5)
